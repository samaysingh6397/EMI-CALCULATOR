    <h3>LIC Personal Loan EMI Calculator ‚Äì Instant Monthly Repayment Estimator (2025)</h3>
    <p>LIC Personal Loan EMI Calculator ‚Äì Instant Monthly Repayment Estimator (2025)
Planning to take a personal loan from LIC Housing Finance? Whether it's for wedding expenses, travel, home renovation, or medical emergencies ‚Äì understanding your EMI beforehand is essential. The LIC Personal Loan EMI Calculator helps you calculate your monthly installment amount based on your loan, interest rate, and repayment period.

What Is LIC Personal Loan EMI?
EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It's the fixed amount you repay each month, which includes both the interest and a portion of the principal amount. LIC offers flexible repayment options, and the EMI calculator helps you understand the exact monthly outflow before you apply.

How to Use the LIC Personal Loan EMI Calculator?
To calculate your EMI, you need three simple inputs:

Loan Amount (Example: ‚Çπ1,00,000 to ‚Çπ20,00,000)

Interest Rate (Generally between 10% to 14%)

Loan Tenure (6 months to 5 years)

Once entered, the EMI calculator gives instant results showing:

Your Monthly EMI

Total Interest Payable

Total Loan Repayment Amount

Example: LIC Personal Loan EMI Calculation
Let‚Äôs say you borrow ‚Çπ3,00,000 for 3 years at 11.5% annual interest. Your monthly EMI will be approximately ‚Çπ9,880. Over the full loan term, you would repay around ‚Çπ3,55,680 ‚Äì which includes ‚Çπ55,680 as interest.
