    <h3>Education Loan EMI Calculator ‚Äì Plan Your Study Loan Repayment Smartly </h3>
    <p>Education Loan EMI Calculator ‚Äì Plan Your Study Loan Repayment Smartly (2025 Guide)
Are you planning to take an education loan in India in 2025 for higher studies in India or abroad? Whether it‚Äôs for engineering, medical, MBA, or a foreign university, knowing your future EMI can help you plan smartly. Our Education Loan EMI Calculator is designed to give you a clear idea of how much you‚Äôll be repaying every month after the moratorium period ends.

üéì What Is an Education Loan EMI Calculator?
An education loan EMI calculator is a free tool that helps students and parents calculate the monthly repayment amount (EMI) they need to pay for a study loan. It‚Äôs based on three key inputs:

Loan Amount (e.g., ‚Çπ5 to ‚Çπ30 lakhs)

Interest Rate (usually 9% to 12%)

Loan Tenure (up to 15 years, after moratorium)

This calculator helps you understand your repayment burden in advance so you can plan your post-graduation finances better.

üìö How Does It Work?
Once your loan is disbursed, the EMI usually begins after the moratorium period, which includes your course duration plus 6‚Äì12 months. After that, EMI is calculated just like other loans:

Formula used:
EMI = [P √ó R √ó (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N ‚Äì 1]
Where:
P = Loan amount
R = Monthly interest rate
N = Number of EMIs (months)

But instead of doing the math yourself, just enter your details in our Education Loan EMI Calculator and get instant results!

üìà Example Calculation
Suppose you take an education loan of ‚Çπ10,00,000 for 10 years at an interest rate of 10%.

Monthly EMI = ‚Çπ13,215 (approx.)

Total Interest = ‚Çπ5,85,800

Total Repayment = ‚Çπ15,85,800

This estimate helps you plan your future salary, savings, and job expectations accordingly.
